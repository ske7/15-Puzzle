## Game introduction

The 15 Puzzle is a classic sliding game. The rule is simple: move blocks until they are in regular order.
You can play and beat online records of time and moves. Also, dedicated fans can discover additional modes of the game.

## Features

1. Traditional mode for casual and beginner players. Beat your personal records of time and moves.
2. Cage mode. The puzzle here is a sliced image that needs to be joined. Solve the puzzle in Cage mode, and you will open a new Cage picture. There are many such images, and opening them all is a challenge. You can obtain all unlocked items in the Cage Image Gallery (press the "Complete" link).
3. Pro mode (speed sliding). The puzzle is represented in a fringe color scheme, and you control movement with mouse hover. This mode is intended for professional and highly skilled experienced players; for world champions in this discipline, and for those who want to be among them. Can you solve "15 puzzle" in 1-2 seconds? It's possible, and several people in the world do this!
4. You can select different puzzle sizes: 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5.
5. Marathon mode: you need to beat five puzzles in a row without any pause.
6. Online records database. Register and your times/moves will be stored and compared to other best results. You can log in to different devices (browsers) with your account.
7. You can configure the game: turn off Cage mode to perfect your records in the traditional game; play in hardcore Cage mode without numbers on blocks; disable Win message if it doesn't suit your game experience. Change control mode or set dark screen mode and others.
